# Introduction  

This assignment is a part of Coursera: Developing Data Products for week 4. This peer assessed assignment has two parts:  
1. Shiny application on Rstudio's servers. [(link)](https://thawatchai-p.shinyapps.io/myapp/)  
2. Slidify presentation about the application.

For the application, the following items must be included:  
1. Some form of input (widget: textbox, radio button, checkbox, ...)  
2. Some operation on the ui input in sever.R  
3. Some reactive output displayed as a result of server calculations  
4. You must also include enough documentation so that a novice user could use your application.  
5. The documentation should be at the Shiny website itself. Do not post to an external link.  

The dataset is the wine dataset, which come from [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wine). It uses the chemical analysis to determine the origin of wines. There are 13 constituents found in each of the three types of wines.  

The objective of application is to predict the class (type) of wine based on the given constituents. Also, there is a scatter plot of 3 highly correlated parameters in order to provide the visualization for further analysis.  

# Data Preparation

```{r data prep, warning=FALSE, echo=TRUE, tidy.opts=list(width.cutoff=60)}  
path <- "D:\\Coursera\\Data Science - Specialization (by Johns Hopkins University)\\9-Developing Data Products\\DevDatProd_AssignWk4\\MyApp"
setwd(path)
# Data reading
raw.data <- read.csv("wine.csv", header = FALSE)
colnames(raw.data) <- c("Class", "Alcohol", "Malic acid", "Ash", "Alkalinity of ash","Magnesium", "Total phenols", "Flavanoids",
                        "Nonflavanoid phenols", "Proanthocyanins", "Color intensity", "Hue", "OD280.OD315", "Proline")
summary(raw.data)
```

# Data analysis

```{r data analysis, warning=FALSE, echo = TRUE, fig.align='center'}  
# Correlation analysis (Correlation Coeff > 0.67)
cor.data <- cor(raw.data)
corrplot(cor.data, method = "color", type = "lower", addCoef.col = "black")
```


# Application interface

Shiny application on Rstudio's servers.  [(link)](https://thawatchai-p.shinyapps.io/myapp/) 

Application interface is captured as following:  

```{r shiny app code, warning=FALSE, echo=TRUE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("./MyApp/AppScreen.png", )
```
